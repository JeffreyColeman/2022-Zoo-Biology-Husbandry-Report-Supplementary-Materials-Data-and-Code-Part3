Here are 2022 COLONY input and output files (the ones in repository 1 are trial files from 2018) as well as a document that lists the official names from the original publications of the heterologous microsatellite marker samples name (in the titles of the alleles.fsa fragment files). Incidentally, alleles.fsa files can be opened in Geneious. Quality improves with optimization from over time (from 2018 to 2019), so the best-amplified heterologous marker alleles, chosen for binning and calling, tended to be from 2019.
